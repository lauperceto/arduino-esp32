## GTA Vice City NFS Underground 2018 Review
 
GTA Vice City NFS Underground 2018 is a mod that combines the best of two worlds: the open-world crime sandbox of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and the street racing culture of Need for Speed: Underground 2. The mod features a new storyline, new cars, new races, new locations, new neon lights and more. The mod was originally released in 2018 and updated in 2021 with an English translation version.
 
The mod is not just a simple conversion of GTA Vice City into NFS Underground 2. It has its own plot and story scenes that involve Tommy Vercetti and other characters from the original game. The mod also adds four types of races: cars, motorcycles, boats and helicopters. Each type of race has its own challenges and rewards. You can buy and customize your vehicles in different showrooms across the city. You can also use nitro to boost your speed, but you have to buy it separately.
